After a lot of small Java tasks and exercises throughout this semester, I felt the need to do a own project for a better learning effect.
I wanted to use some of the technologies and patterns learned but also keep it simple, so that I would be able to finish it in a few days to weeks. 
Due to a lack of creativity after weeks of exam preparation I couldn't think of anything better than a simple ToDo App.



**Technologies used (or planned to use):**

- Gradle
- SpringBoot Rest Framework
- JUnit
- Mockito
- Docker
- MySQL
